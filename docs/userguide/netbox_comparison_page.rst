NetBox Comparison Page
**********************

The concept of NetBox Comparisons was created to track the differences between a data model in Orthos 2 and NetBox at
the comparison point. This was introduced to help detect differences between Orthos 2 and NetBox records, before the
nightly pull-based data sync overwrites the data in Orthos2.

.. note:: Comparison results are deleted after two weeks at the moment to save space in the database.

.. note:: This page is only visible to you if you have administrator rights.
