  :alt: Orthos2 Machine Add with NetBox

This feature is meant as a shortcut for adding new machines into Orthos 2 that are primarily recorded in NetBox. To add
a machine fill in the NetBox ID, System type and choose between "Device" and "Virtual Machine". The NetBox ID can be
found in the URL of the object in NetBox.
