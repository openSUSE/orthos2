Orthos provides the ability to use an interactive serial console in the web browser for each machine that has an entry
for a serial console. The WebSocket communication protocol is used for this. To start the WebSocket service, the
following command line must be executed (no HTTPS/TLS):

.. code-block::

    $ orthos-admin serialconsole-ws --start
    Start websocket daemon on port 8010...


With HTTPS/TLS:

.. code-block::

    $ orthos-admin serialconsole-ws --start --wss\
        --crt <certificate>\
        --key <key>
    Start websocket daemon on port 8010...


Example:

.. code-block::

    $ orthos-admin serialconsole-ws --start --wss\
        --crt /etc/apache2/ssl.crt/orthos.network.tld.crt\
        --key /etc/apache2/ssl.key/orthos.network.tld.pem
    Start websocket daemon on port 8010...


Further configuraton information can be found in the :ref:`admin-guide` (``websocket.*``).

When the service establishes a SSH connection to invoke a command on a remote server, a SSH key without password is
recommended. The key path just needs to be added to the SSH command (``-i <identity_file>``).

The output is available in the machine view under the tab ``Serial Console``.

This feature was tested with Chromium Version 62.0.3202.89 (64-bit) and Firefox 52.5.0 (64-bit).
